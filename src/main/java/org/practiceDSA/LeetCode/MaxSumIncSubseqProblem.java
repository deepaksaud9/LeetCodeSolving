/*
    Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence Problem
        Find a subsequence of a given sequence such that the subsequence sum is as high as possible and
        the subsequenceâ€™s elements are sorted in ascending order. This subsequence is not necessarily
        contiguous or unique.
        Please note that the problem specifically targets subsequences that need not be contiguous, i.e.,
        subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.
        For example, consider the subsequences {0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11}.
